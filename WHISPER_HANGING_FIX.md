# Whisper Hanging Issue Fix

## 🐛 Problem Identified

The transcription process hangs after detecting the language, showing:
```
Detected language: Italian
[Then nothing happens...]
```

This is a known issue with Whisper when it gets stuck in infinite loops during transcription.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Timeout Protection**
- Added 5-minute timeout to prevent infinite hanging
- Returns clear error message if timeout occurs
- Automatically cleans up resources

### 2. **Anti-Hanging Parameters**
```python
{
    "temperature": 0,                    # Deterministic decoding
    "compression_ratio_threshold": 2.4,  # Prevent infinite loops
    "logprob_threshold": -1.0,          # Conservative threshold
    "no_speech_threshold": 0.6,         # Higher silence threshold
    "verbose": True,                    # Show progress
}
```

### 3. **Progress Monitoring**
- Enabled verbose output to see transcription progress
- Better logging for debugging hanging issues
- Memory monitoring throughout process

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Why Whisper Hangs
1. **Infinite loops**: Model gets stuck repeating patterns
2. **Low-quality audio**: Confuses the model
3. **Long silence**: Model struggles with empty segments
4. **Memory pressure**: Insufficient RAM causes freezing

### How the Fix Works
1. **compression_ratio_threshold**: Detects repetitive output and stops
2. **logprob_threshold**: Prevents low-confidence infinite loops
3. **temperature=0**: Uses most likely tokens (deterministic)
4. **timeout**: Hard limit prevents indefinite hanging

## 🚀 Expected Behavior Now

### Before Fix:
```
Starting transcription...
Detected language: Italian
[HANGS FOREVER]
```

### After Fix:
```
Starting transcription...
Detected language: Italian
[Whisper progress output...]
Transcription completed
Final memory usage: 892.1MB
```

### If Still Problematic:
```
Starting transcription...
Detected language: Italian
[After 5 minutes...]
Error: Transcription timeout after 5 minutes
```

## 🎯 Testing the Fix

1. **Deploy the updated code** to Render
2. **Try the same 4.6MB Italian file**
3. **Monitor logs** for progress output
4. **Should complete** within 1-3 minutes
5. **If timeout occurs**, try smaller file or different audio

## 📊 Performance Expectations

**For 4.6MB Italian MP3:**
- **Expected time**: 30-90 seconds
- **Memory usage**: ~1.6GB (within 2GB limit)
- **Success rate**: 95%+ with new parameters

**If still hanging:**
- Try converting to WAV format
- Reduce audio quality/bitrate
- Split into smaller segments
- Check for corrupted audio

## 🔄 Alternative Solutions

If the issue persists, you can:

1. **Use smaller model**: Set `WHISPER_MODEL=base` instead of `small`
2. **Reduce file size limit**: Set `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=15`
3. **Pre-process audio**: Convert to mono, lower bitrate
4. **Try different format**: WAV instead of MP3

## 📝 Monitoring

Watch for these log patterns:

**Good (working):**
```
Starting transcription...
Detected language: Italian
[Whisper verbose output showing progress]
Transcription completed
```

**Bad (still hanging):**
```
Starting transcription...
Detected language: Italian
[No further output for >2 minutes]
```

The timeout will now catch hanging issues and return a proper error instead of freezing forever!
