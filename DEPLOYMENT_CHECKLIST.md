## üìã GitHub Deployment Steps

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
- [ ] Go to GitHub.com and create new repository
- [ ] Name: `srt-api`
- [ ] Description: "Audio Transcription API that converts audio files to SRT subtitles using FastAPI and OpenAI Whisper"
- [ ] Set as Public (or Private)
- [ ] Do NOT initialize with README/gitignore

### 2. Push Code to GitHub
```bash
cd /Users/arjanpapot/Desktop/n8n-dashboard/audio-transcription-api
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/srt-api.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify GitHub Repository
- [ ] All 13 files uploaded successfully
- [ ] README.md displays properly
- [ ] No sensitive files (.env) committed
- [ ] Repository description and topics set

## üöÄ Render Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Render
- [ ] Sign up/login to Render.com
- [ ] Connect GitHub account
- [ ] Select `srt-api` repository

### 2. Configure Web Service
- [ ] **Name**: `srt-api`
- [ ] **Environment**: Python 3
- [ ] **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] **Start Command**: `python start.py`

### 3. Set Environment Variables
- [ ] `PORT` = `10000`
- [ ] `HOST` = `0.0.0.0`
- [ ] `WHISPER_MODEL` = `base`
- [ ] `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` = `100`
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGINS` = `*`
- [ ] `ENVIRONMENT` = `production`

### 4. Configure Instance
- [ ] Choose appropriate instance type:
  - Free: 512MB RAM (limited)
  - Starter: 512MB RAM ($7/month)
  - Standard: 2GB RAM ($25/month) - Recommended

### 5. Deploy and Test
- [ ] Click "Create Web Service"
- [ ] Wait for build completion (5-10 minutes)
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `https://your-app.onrender.com/health`
- [ ] Test API docs: `https://your-app.onrender.com/docs`
- [ ] Test file upload functionality

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### API Functionality
- [ ] Health check returns 200 OK
- [ ] API documentation loads correctly
- [ ] File upload accepts supported formats
- [ ] File size validation works (rejects >100MB)
- [ ] Transcription produces valid SRT files
- [ ] Error handling works for invalid files

### Performance
- [ ] First request completes (may take 30-60s for model download)
- [ ] Subsequent requests are faster
- [ ] No memory errors in logs
- [ ] No timeout errors for reasonable file sizes

### Security
- [ ] CORS configured appropriately
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in logs
- [ ] Environment variables properly set
- [ ] API accessible only via HTTPS

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Build Fails:**
- Check requirements.txt syntax
- Verify Python version compatibility
- Review build logs in Render dashboard

**Memory Issues:**
- Upgrade to larger instance type
- Use smaller Whisper model (`tiny` instead of `base`)
- Reduce max file size limit

**Timeout Errors:**
- Upgrade instance type for better performance
- Reduce file size limits
- Check for infinite loops in code

**Model Download Fails:**
- Restart service
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify Whisper model name

## üìä Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
- [ ] Response times (should be <30s for most files)
- [ ] Memory usage (should stay under instance limit)
- [ ] Error rates (should be <5%)
- [ ] Uptime (should be >99%)

### Log Monitoring
- [ ] Check for memory warnings
- [ ] Monitor for timeout errors
- [ ] Watch for model loading issues
- [ ] Track file upload patterns

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- [ ] API responds to health checks
- [ ] Documentation is accessible
- [ ] File uploads work end-to-end
- [ ] SRT files are generated correctly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for your use case
- [ ] No critical errors in logs

## üìû Support Resources

- **Render Documentation**: https://render.com/docs
- **FastAPI Documentation**: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
- **OpenAI Whisper**: https://github.com/openai/whisper
- **Project Repository**: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/srt-api

## üîÑ Updates and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monitor usage and performance
- [ ] Update dependencies periodically
- [ ] Review and rotate any API keys
- [ ] Backup important data if needed
- [ ] Scale instance type based on usage

### Version Updates
- [ ] Test updates locally first
- [ ] Use Git tags for releases
- [ ] Document breaking changes
- [ ] Plan maintenance windows for major updates
